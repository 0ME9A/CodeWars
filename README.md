# CodeWars Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various challenges from the CodeWars platform. CodeWars is an online platform that offers coding challenges to improve coding skills and learn new programming concepts.

The `codeWars` folder contains a collection of katas, organized in separate program folders. Each program folder represents a specific coding challenge.

Inside each program folder, you will find the following files:

- `programX.js` (or `.py`, `.ts`, etc.): The code solution for the corresponding challenge, written in JavaScript (or Python, TypeScript, etc.).
- `readme.md`: A readme file providing a description of the challenge and explanation of the code solution. It includes details about the problem statement, input/output format, and any additional notes.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the different program folders to find solutions to specific coding challenges. Each program folder contains the program files in different programming languages, allowing you to choose the implementation that suits your needs.

To use a particular solution:

1. Navigate to the desired program folder.
2. Choose the programming language of your choice.
3. Open the corresponding program file (e.g., `program1.js` for JavaScript, `program1.py` for Python).
4. Read the code and understand the logic behind the solution.
5. Copy the code and use it in your own projects or CodeWars submissions.

Make sure to refer to the accompanying `readme.md` file for each program, as it provides a detailed description of the problem statement and any specific instructions.
