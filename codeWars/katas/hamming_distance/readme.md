# Hamming Distance

The Hamming Distance is a measure of similarity between two strings of equal length. This program calculates the number of positions where the input strings do not match.

## Usage

The `hammingDistance` function takes two input strings of equal length and returns the Hamming distance between them.

```javascript
const a = "I like turtles";
const b = "I like turkeys";
console.log(hammingDistance(a, b)); // Output: 3
```

## Example

```javascript
const a = "I like turtles";
const b = "I like turkeys";
console.log(hammingDistance(a, b)); // Output: 3
```
