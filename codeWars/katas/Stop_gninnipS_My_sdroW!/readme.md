# Stop gninnipS My sdroW!

Write a function that takes in a string of one or more words, and returns the same string, but with all five or more letter words reversed _(Just like the name of this Kata)_. Strings passed in will consist of only letters and spaces. Spaces will be included only when more than one word is present.

## Examples:

```javascript
spinWords("Hey fellow warriors"); // "Hey wollef sroirraw"
spinWords("This is a test"); // "This is a test"
spinWords("This is another test"); // "This is rehtona test"
```
