# Reverse Words in a String

In this problem, the task is to reverse all the words within a given string.

### Function Signature

```python
def reverse_words(str: str) -> str:
    # code goes here
```

## Input

- `str`: A string consisting of words separated by exactly one space. There are no leading or trailing spaces.

## Output

- Returns a new string with the words in reversed order.

## Example

```python
Copy code
print(reverse_words("hello world!"))

# Output: "world! hello"
```

## Note

The solution splits the string into a list of words using the space delimiter, reverses the list, and then joins the words back into a string using spaces.
