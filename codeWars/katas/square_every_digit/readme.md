# Square Every Digit

The "Square Every Digit" kata is a simple exercise that involves squaring each digit of a given number and concatenating the results.

## Task

Complete the `squareDigits` function that takes an integer as input and returns the result of squaring every digit and concatenating them.

## Example

```javascript
console.log(squareDigits(9119)); // Output: 811181
console.log(squareDigits(765)); // Output: 493625
```

## Explanation

For the input `9119`, the function squares each digit individually:

- 9 squared is 81
- 1 squared is 1
- 1 squared is 1
- 9 squared is 81

The resulting squares are then concatenated to form the final output: `811181`.

Similarly, for the input `765`, the function squares each digit individually:

- 7 squared is 49
- 6 squared is 36
- 5 squared is 25

The resulting squares are then concatenated to form the final output: `493625`.
